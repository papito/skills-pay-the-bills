## General notes

Avoid documentation drift. When related code is added, changed, or removed, update AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, and ARCHITECTURE.md if they exist.

When adding features or modifying existing behavior, review nearby code comments and update them where needed.

Always add comments for less than trivial logic, unless the comment is redundant with the code, and it's a simple getter/setter or similar. 
If you find yourself writing a comment that starts with "This is needed because..." or "This exists to work around...", consider whether the code can be refactored to eliminate the need for the comment.

Always log on INFO important events and log on DEBUG events that may be useful for debugging. Avoid logging on DEBUG events that are too noisy to be useful (use TRACE if available).

After running make test, run make lint to catch formatting and style issues.

## Code Style and Quality

### Server-side

Extract shared logic into functions when the same or similar logic appears more than once.

Write the smallest amount of code that preserves clarity, readability, and maintainability.

### Front-end

Use the fewest props and the least markup needed to accomplish the task.

Do not assume aesthetic preferences such as color, spacing, or padding unless they are specified.

Strongly prefer CSS Grid and Flexbox over floats, manual positioning, or table-based layouts.

Identify the main CSS file and use :root variables. Example: 

```css
:root {
    color-scheme: light dark;

    --background-color: #363636;
    --background-form-color: #363535;
    --background-secondary-color: rgb(56, 56, 65);
    --background-tertiary-color: rgb(75, 75, 87);
}
```
