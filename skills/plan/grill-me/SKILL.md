description: Grilling session that challenges your plan against the existing domain model, sharpens terminology, and updates documentation (CONTEXT.md, ADRs) inline as decisions crystallise. Use when user wants to stress-test a plan against their project's language and documented decisions.
---

<what-to-do>

Interview me relentlessly about every aspect of this plan until we reach a shared understanding. Walk down each branch of the design tree, resolving dependencies between decisions one-by-one. For each question, provide your recommended answer.

Ask the questions one at a time, waiting for feedback on each question before continuing.

If a question can be answered by exploring the codebase, explore the codebase instead.

The outcome of this exercise is a new plan – NOT code. The plan should be saved in the `plans/` directory (choose a name that makes sense for the task).
Create the directory if it does not exist.

After all questions are answered, determine the smallest possible set of changes that can be made to the codebase to bring the plan into alignment with the domain model and the project's language.
The changes need to be grouped into logical units that can be easily reviewed and merged. For each unit of work, provide a concise description of the change and its rationale. Use a numbered list to list the changes
so that they can be easily referenced in the future.

Order the tasks into a directed acyclic graph, so that sub-agents could implement these in parallel. 

The resulting plan should start with the original goals of the larger task.

## Domain awareness

During codebase exploration, also look for existing documentation:

### File structure

Most repos have a single context:

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
└── src/
```

If a `CONTEXT-MAP.md` exists at the root, the repo has multiple contexts. The map points to where each one lives:

```
/
├── CONTEXT-MAP.md
├── src/
│   ├── ordering/
│   │   ├── CONTEXT.md
│   └── billing/
│       ├── CONTEXT.md
```

Create files lazily — only when you have something to write. If no `CONTEXT.md` exists, create one when the first term is resolved.

## During the session

### Challenge against the glossary

When the user uses a term that conflicts with the existing language in `CONTEXT.md`, call it out immediately. "Your glossary defines 'cancellation' as X, but you seem to mean Y — which is it?"

### Sharpen fuzzy language

When the user uses vague or overloaded terms, propose a precise canonical term. "You're saying 'account' — do you mean the Customer or the User? Those are different things."

### Discuss concrete scenarios

When domain relationships are being discussed, stress-test them with specific scenarios. Invent scenarios that probe edge cases and force the user to be precise about the boundaries between concepts.

### Cross-reference with code

When the user states how something works, check whether the code agrees. If you find a contradiction, surface it: "Your code cancels entire Orders, but you just said partial cancellation is possible — which is right?"

### Update CONTEXT.md inline

When a term is resolved, update `CONTEXT.md` right there. Don't batch these up — capture them as they happen. Use the format in [CONTEXT-FORMAT.md](./CONTEXT-FORMAT.md).

`CONTEXT.md` should be totally devoid of implementation details. Do not treat `CONTEXT.md` as a spec, a scratch pad, or a repository for implementation decisions. It is a glossary and nothing else.
